| react-shared-state-hook | 1.0.5 |
| ----------------------- | ----- |

A simple yet powerful way to share state between components and hooks.

- The convenience of `redux` without the complexity

- Lightweight and easy to use

- Quickly prototype

## Why this package?

Sharing state is one of the most important concepts in React, and while there exists numerous solutions from `redux`, `rxjs`, `context`, etc. each has their own drawbacks.

This package provides a quick and seemless way to share state from a single integer to comlpex objects, between as many components as you need!

## Installation

```bash
npm install @development-laboritories/react-shared-state-hook
```

or

```bash
yarn add @development-laboritories/react-shared-state-hook
```

## Basic Usage

Use the following to import the `createSharedHook` function which is used to create a hook with shared state:

```ts
import { createSharedState } from "@development-laboritories/react-shared-state-hook";
```

Now we can pass in an `initialValue` in this case **"en"** and we get back a new shared state hook:

```ts
// create a shared state hook that will be initialized with "english"
const useSharedLocale = createSharedState("english");

// now we can export a new hook which contains the shared state
export function useLocale() {
  const [locale, setLocale] = useSharedLocale(); // locale will be "english"

  useEffect(() => {
    setLocale(Device.systemLocale); // example
  }, []);

  return { locale, setLocale };
}
```

In this example we have two components that now share the same state, without the need of re-rendering any parents, adding another provider to the dom, or having to implement a new redux reducer, action, etc.

```ts
import { useLocale } from "./useLocale";

// example component #1
function SpanishLanguageButton() {
  const { setLocale } = useSharedLocale();
  return <button onClick={() => setLocale("spanish")}>{locale}</button>;
}

// example component #2
function ItalianLanguageButton() {
  const { setLocale } = useSharedLocale();
  return <button onClick={() => setLocale("italian")}>{locale}</button>;
}

// example component #3
function CurrentLanguage() {
  const { locale } = useSharedLocale();
  return <p>{`The current language is ${locale}`}</p>;
}
```

Now all three of these components will share exactly the same state, no matter where they are in the DOM!
